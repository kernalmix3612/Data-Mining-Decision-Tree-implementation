Abstract:
This is a Data Mining project. It's main purpose is to implement Decision Tree.

Coding Environment:
- MacOS BigSur
    - Python 3.8.3 
        - pandas
        - numpy
        - sklearn    
    - Jupyher Notebook 6.0.3

Required Data:
-Ecoli.csv
-Ecoli_test.csv

The following guide will tell you how to run this code. 


Program execution steps:
1. Read Training Data Ecoli.CSVÂ¶. 
2. Creating New Training Data testlsolation.csv. 
3. Fill in the null values in Training data. 
4. Anomaly detection for training data. 
5. Delete Outliers and save it as deloutlier.csv. 
6. Spilit Training data's ground truth  
7. Standard Normal Distribution for Training Data. 
8. Start doing Decision Tree
9. Showing Training results (Precision, Recall,F1-score, Accuracy). 
10. Read Testing Data Ecoli_test.csv. 
11. Creating New Testing Data NewEcoli_Test.csv. 
12. Anomaly detection for training data. 
13. Delete Outliers and save it as deloutliertest.csv. 
14. Standard Normal Distribution for Training Data
15. Making predictions for testing data. 
16. Save the prediction result as s4603983.csv
